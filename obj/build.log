Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.

If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.
WARNING: [DRC DPOP-2] MREG Output pipelining: DSP corner_finder/index_x1 multiplier stage corner_finder/index_x1/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.
WARNING: [DRC DPOP-2] MREG Output pipelining: DSP mirror_m/pixel_addr_out_reg multiplier stage mirror_m/pixel_addr_out_reg/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0).

WARNING: [DRC DPREG-4] DSP48E1_PregDynOpmodeZmuxP:: The DSP48E1 cell corner_finder/index_x3 with the given dynamic OPMODE[6:0] connections may lead to an unregistered asynchronous feedback path without the PREG attribute enabled. Please refer to the user guide and if one of the internal P feedback opmodes is possible for this design the PREG attribute must be set to 1, currently set to 0
WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net scale_m/cam_out_reg[15]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin scale_m/cam_out_reg[15]_i_2/O, cell scale_m/cam_out_reg[15]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
